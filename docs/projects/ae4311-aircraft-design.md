# Complete Aircraft Design (AE 4311)

**Course:** AE 4311 – Aircraft Design  
**Term:** Fall 2025  
**Project Type:** Semester-long team design  
**Aircraft:** Six-passenger single-engine turboprop (low-wing, T-tail)

---

## Overview
Designed a complete preliminary aircraft configuration starting from mission requirements and progressing through configuration selection, sizing, performance analysis, weight and balance, and stability evaluation. The design emphasizes realistic constraints, feasibility, and comparison to existing turboprop aircraft.

- **Maximum Takeoff Weight:** ~9,700 lb  
- **Cruise Speed:** 180 kt at 20,000 ft  
- **Design Range:** 1,750 nmi + 45-min reserve  
- **Wing Area:** 346.4 ft²  
- **Wing Loading:** ~28 lb/ft²  
- **Power Loading:** ~0.078 hp/lbf  
- **Configuration:** Low-wing, single-engine turboprop, T-tail  
- **Fuselage Length:** 36 ft

## My Contributions
- Aircraft sizing using constraint analysis  
- Performance estimation (takeoff, climb, cruise, stall, range)  
- Component-level weight estimation  
- CG excursion and static margin analysis  
- Support on configuration trade studies and final documentation  

---

## Key Analyses
- Constraint sizing used to select wing and power loading  
- Weight breakdown and CG excursion across loading cases  
- Neutral point estimation using tail volume and lift-curve slopes  
- Verified positive static margin across all loading conditions  

---

## Results
- Mission and performance requirements satisfied  
- CG envelope remains forward of the neutral point for all cases  
- Configuration balances aerodynamic efficiency, stability, and practicality  
- Weight class and configuration are consistent with comparable GA turboprop programs
