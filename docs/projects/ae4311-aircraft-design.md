# Complete Aircraft Design
**Course:** AE 4311 – Aircraft Design  
**Term:** Fall 2025  
**Project Type:** Team-based, semester-long design  
**Role:** Individual contributor within a design team

## Overview
Designed a complete aircraft from initial mission requirements through configuration selection, sizing, performance analysis, stability evaluation, and overall feasibility. The project emphasized systems-level trade studies, engineering judgment, and realistic constraints informed by existing aircraft.

---

## Mission Definition
The aircraft was designed to satisfy a defined operational mission including:
- Payload and range requirements
- Cruise speed and altitude targets
- Takeoff and landing field length constraints
- Regulatory and operational considerations

Mission requirements were translated into quantitative design targets used throughout sizing and trade studies.

---

## Configuration Selection
Multiple aircraft configurations were evaluated using structured trade studies and weighted decision matrices. Key considerations included performance, stability, manufacturability, and operational practicality.

**Final configuration:**
- Low-wing layout  
- Single-engine turboprop propulsion  
- T-tail configuration  

This configuration provided a balanced solution across aerodynamic efficiency, stability, and structural integration.

## Sizing and Performance Analysis
Aircraft sizing was performed using constraint analysis to determine feasible wing loading and power loading combinations.

Key analyses included:
- Takeoff and landing performance constraints
- Climb and cruise performance requirements
- Stall speed limits
- Range and endurance feasibility

The final design point was selected to satisfy all constraints with appropriate margins.

## Weight and Balance
A component-level weight estimation was conducted to generate a complete mass breakdown. Center of gravity (CG) locations were estimated for major components and evaluated across multiple loading scenarios.

Analyses performed:
- Total weight buildup and mass fractions
- CG excursion across loading cases
- Static margin and neutral point estimation

The final design maintained acceptable stability margins throughout the operational envelope.

## Stability and Feasibility
Longitudinal static stability was assessed using neutral point estimation and static margin calculations. The design was verified to be stable across expected loading conditions while meeting mission performance requirements.

Design feasibility was evaluated by comparison against existing aircraft in a similar class to ensure realistic sizing and performance.
